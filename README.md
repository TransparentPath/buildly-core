A gateway and service discovery system for “micro” services. A light weight Gateway that connects all of your data services, API’s and endpoints to a single easy-to-use URL.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* Docker version 19+

### Installing

Build first the image:

```bash
docker-compose build # --no-cache to force dependencies installation
```

To run the webserver (go to 127.0.0.1:8080):

```bash
docker-compose up # -d for detached
```

User: `admin`
Password: `admin`.

To run the webserver with pdb support:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm --service-ports buildly
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests without flake8:

```bash
docker-compose run --entrypoint '/usr/bin/env' --rm buildly bash scripts/run-tests.sh --keepdb
```

To run the tests like if it was CI with flake8:

```bash
docker-compose run --entrypoint '/usr/bin/env' --rm buildly bash scripts/run-tests.sh --ci
```

See `pytest --help` for more options.

## Deployment

The instructions in the next three subsections [Configure the API authentication](#configure-the-api-authentication), [Generating RSA keys](#generating-rsa-keys), and [Configuration](#configuration) will explain how to configure a Buildly Core instance to have it on a live system.

### Configure the API authentication

All clients interact with our API using the OAuth2 protocol. In order to configure it, go to `admin/oauth2_provider/application/` and add a new application there.

### Generating RSA keys

For using JWT as authentication method, we need to configure public and
private RSA keys.

The following commands will generate a public and private key. The private
key will stay in Buildly and the public one will be supplied to
microservices in order to verify the authenticity of the message:

```bash
$ openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
$ openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
```

### Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of buildly and their default values.
